Integral Points Inside Triangle
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 76.62%Submissions: 2K+Points: 4
Given three non-collinear points whose co-ordinates are p(p1, p2), q(q1, q2) and r(r1, r2) in the X-Y plane. Return the number of integral / lattice points strictly inside the triangle formed by these points.
Note: - A point in the X-Y plane is said to be an integral / lattice point if both its coordinates are integral.

Examples

Input: p = (0,0), q = (0,5), r = (5,0)
Output: 6
Explanation: 

As shown in figure, points (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,1) (2,2) and (3,1) are the integral points inside the triangle. So total 6 are there.
Input: p = (62,-3), q = (5,-45), r = (-19,-23)
Output: 1129
Explanation: There are 1129 integral points in the triangle formed by p, q and r.
