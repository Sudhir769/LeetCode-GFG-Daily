You are given an array of integer nums[] where each number represents a vote to a candidate. Return the candidates that have votes greater than one-third of the total votes, If there's not a majority vote, return -1. 

Note: The answer should be returned in an increasing format.

Examples:

Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
Output: [5, 6]
Explanation: 5 and 6 occur more n/3 times.
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: no candidate occur more than n/3 times.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraint:
1 <= nums.size() <= 106
0 <= nums[i] <= 109
