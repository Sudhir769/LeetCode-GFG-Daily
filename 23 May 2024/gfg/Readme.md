Given a string str of length n, find if the string is K-Palindrome or not. A k-palindrome string transforms into a palindrome on removing at most k characters from it.


Example 1:

Input: str = "abcdecba"
n = 8, k = 1
Output: 1
Explaination: By removing 'd' or 'e' 
we can make it a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input: str = "abcdefcba"
n = 9, k = 1
Output: 0
Explaination: By removing a single 
character we cannot make it a palindrome.

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kPalindrome() which takes string str, n, and k as input parameters and returns 1 if str is a K-palindrome else returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*n)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n, k ≤ 103
