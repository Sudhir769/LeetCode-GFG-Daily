Given a number n, find the number of binary strings of length n that contain consecutive 1's in them. Since the number can be very large, return the answer after modulo with 1e9+7.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 2
Output:
1
Explanation:
There are 4 strings of 
length 2, the strings 
are 00, 01, 10, and 
11. Only the string 11 
has consecutive 1's.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
Output:
19
Explanation:
There are 19 strings
having consecutive 1's.
Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function numberOfConsecutiveOnes() which takes an integer n and returns the number of binary strings that contain consecutive 1's in them.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints
2 <= n <= 105
